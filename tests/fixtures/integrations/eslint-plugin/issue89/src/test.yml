      I like. I tried to make it as accessible as possible. However there might
      be bugs, and if you find any, you can {contact}. If you are a developer,
      you can also {contribute}. Finally, if you want to contribute in another

      A lot of small potatoes from the marvelous community of Robynn Frauhn were
      used to the Pomodoro technique to help them work. As in Robynn's oasis,
      potatoes reign, they decided to replace tomates in their technique. This
      is how was born the Potato technique and its Potato Timer.

  technique:
    content: >-
      The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique. It consists of
      defining periods of work, separated by smaller periods of pause. Before
      starting, several tasks should be planned, so they can be worked on during
      work time. It can be split in 5 steps:
    steps:
      - Defining the task to work on.
      - Setup a work timer (25 minutes).
      - Work on the task for 25 minutes.
      - Take a 5 minute break.
      - Start over with a 15-30 minute pause on the 4th cycle.
